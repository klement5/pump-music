Hey there! Welcome to Pump.Music.
Ever heard someone say, "Oh, I was listening to them back when they had just 20K listeners on Spotify?"

If you’ve got an ear for discovering artists early and want to support them in a real way—Pump.Music is for you.

With just a Spotify URL, you can mint an artist token and trade it on a decentralized exchange.

Here’s how it works:

1. A unique token is created for the artist—e.g., TheWeeknd mints $WKND.
2. The token can be bought and sold on pump.music
3. An escrow wallet collects trading fees, which the artist can claim upon verifying their identity.

Now, fans can show real support, create social signals, and prove they were here first.

Put your flag on the moon—discover and back artists early with Pump.Music."

# How it works

1. Navigate to our frontpage to be able to find artist tokens
2. If an artist does not have an artist token yet, then you can launch an artist token for the specific artist
3. On the frontpage you are able to buy the new artist token
4. if you have artist tokens, then you can sell your tokens
